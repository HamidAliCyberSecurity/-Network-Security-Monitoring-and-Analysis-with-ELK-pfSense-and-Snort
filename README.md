# Network Security Monitoring and Analysis with ELK, pfSense, and Snort

## Overview
This project integrates pfSense and Kali Linux with the ELK Stack for centralized log collection, parsing, and visualization. Logs from Snort on pfSense and syslog-ng on Kali are forwarded to Logstash running in Docker. The ELK Stack provides real-time monitoring of firewall activity, threat detection, and system event analysis for SOC operations.

## Key Features
- Centralized log collection from pfSense (firewall) and Kali Linux (syslog-ng).  
- Real-time parsing and visualization using ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).  
- Threat detection and firewall activity monitoring with Snort alerts.  
- Supports SOC workflows and incident response analysis.

## Tools & Technologies
- ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)  
- pfSense Firewall & Snort IDS/IPS  
- Kali Linux & Syslog-ng  
- Docker Containers  
- Security Monitoring & Threat Detection
